                    <h1>Skos</h1>

                    <p><span class="italics">Skos</span> is a make-believe brand that is centred around sustainability and health. The brief required designing packaging for dried foods that come in a set of three. </p>
                    
                    <p>The design of this set reimagines and challenges the use of dried herbs in the way it is packaged. While herbs are often used for cooking purposes, they are also known for their medicinal properties. With this in mind, the packaging of the inner contents resembles pill packaging. The pockets of herbs are held together by linen which contain the exact amount of herbs needed to brew a concoction. The outer packaging includes an illustration of the main ingredient at the front, and a glossary of the ingredients used on the back. The design of the boxes work as a standalone piece as well as in a set, bound together by a belly band.</p>

                    <p>The material composition of this packaging encourages sustainable practice as it is completely either biodegradable or recyclable.</p>
